# Project 3: Density Functional Theory and Machine Learning
## Running Offline

To run this repo offline:
1. make sure you are running python 3.7, ideally in a [conda env](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html). You can check this by running `python --version` on the command line.
2. clone this repo to your local machine using git [(instructions for cloning git repos from github)](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)
3. navigate to the repo on the command line and then install the dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt` (we recommend you do this in a [conda environment](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1477360/discussion_topics/5508385))
4. run the command `jupyter notebook` in the terminal and the notebook server should pop up in a browser.

This local server will maintain its state so you can use it without worrying about losing your work.
